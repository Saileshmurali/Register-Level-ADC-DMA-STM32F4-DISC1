# Register-Level-ADC-DMA-STM32F4-DISC1
ADC 1, channel 1 has been used in this above code. The pin corresponding to this is PA1. DMA2 stream 0, channel 0 has been used. The ADC clock has been configured to give a sampling rate of approximately 8KHz. The DMA also gets filled after 8000 samples. Both half complete and full complete interrupt for DMA has been configured. So, the LED inside DMA interrupt toggles after 4000 samples get filled first (half complete) and then after the next 4000 samples get filled in the buffer (full completion). So, the LED toggles approximately once around 0.5 seconds.
